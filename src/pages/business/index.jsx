      'My production style is based on ambient/fantasy like sounds that are reminiscent of Japanese role-playing games. Iâ€™m always looking for new and innovative ways to incorporate different sounds and styles into my work, and I am constantly experimenting and pushing the boundaries of music itself. While taking the time to build my sound, I have gotten into sound design as well.',
